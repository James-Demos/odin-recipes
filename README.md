The project is a practice of my nascent HTML skills
I will be practicing HTML boilerplate setup, links, images, other elements as necessary for meaningful and efefctive display of content.
And in addition, I will be practicing the organization of files and directories for a website via the command line. Plus the usage of git.
Pretty exciting stuff!
